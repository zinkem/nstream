type: object
properties:
  highWaterMark:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Buffer level when stream.write() starts returning false.
      Default: 16384 (16KB), or 16 for objectMode streams.
    default: 16384
    minimumValue: 0
  decodeString:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether to encode strings passed to stream.write() to Buffers (with the
      encoding specified in the stream.write() call) before passing them to
      stream._write(). Other types of data are not converted (i.e. Buffers are not
      decoded into strings). Setting to false will prevent strings from being
      converted.
    default: true
  defaultEncoding:
    type: string
    description: |
      The default encoding that is used when no encoding is specified as an
      argument to stream.write().
    default: utf8
    enum:
      - utf8
  objectMode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether or not the stream.write(anyObj) is a valid operation. When set, it
      becomes possible to write JavaScript values other than string, Buffer or
      Uint8Array if supported by the stream implementation.
    default: false
  emitClose:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether or not the stream should emit 'close' after it has been destroyed.
    default: true
  write:
    type: Function
    description: |
      Implementation for the stream._write() method.
  writev:
    type: Function
    description: |
      Implementation for the stream._writev() method.
  destroy:
    type: Function
    description: |
      Implementation for the stream._destroy() method.
  final:
    type: Function
    description: |
      Implementation for the stream._final() method.
  autoDestroy:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether this stream should automatically call .destroy() on itself after ending. Default: true.
